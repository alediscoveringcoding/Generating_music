AI Music Generator - Current Implementation Status
=================================================

The system currently uses ADVANCED SYNTHESIS with:
✅ Genre-specific timbres (sine, square, sawtooth waves)
✅ UNIQUE CHORD PROGRESSIONS per genre
✅ VOCAL SYNTHESIS with lyrics
✅ REVERB and spatial effects
✅ HARMONICS for richness
✅ DYNAMIC VELOCITY patterns
✅ TEMPERATURE-BASED variation

WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN BASIC MAGENTA:
- Magenta models require large pre-trained checkpoint files
- Our synthesis is faster and more controllable
- Each genre sounds distinctly different
- Real lyrics/vocals are unique to this system
- Customizable per-genre parameters

TO FURTHER IMPROVE:
1. Add more sophisticated effects (EQ, compression, distortion)
2. Implement proper DSP filtering for instruments
3. Add percussion tracks for Rock, Pop, Electronic
4. Implement polyphony (multiple instruments)
5. Use neural vocoder for realistic voices
